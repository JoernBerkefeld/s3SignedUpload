# s3SignedUpload
required scripts to add s3 upload to your web-app via presigned URLs

####Important####
Make sure your client (the demo.html) is opened via HTTPS and not via HTTP. Not quite sure if that's a requirement from AWS but right now it only works if you upload from a website opened via https://.
